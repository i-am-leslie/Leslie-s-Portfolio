My personal website.
This is my personal website developed with React, a javascript library used for building user interfaces. It serves as a portfolio for my work. It showcases my projects and some inspirational quotes that keep me pushing.
## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies: Next, you can start the development server with: npm start
Feel free to use this code to help build your own web applications. I'm trying to use best practices as much as possible. Although, try to not copy paste everything.
Tools used:
● React as the library to build the user interface.
● Vercel to continuously build and deploy the application ● Prettier to make my code look pretty
● React icons a library to add good looking icons
I will be making more changes and improving the website from time to time so be sure to keep looking out


Yet to implement
The next updates coming to this project would be integrating react-router and adding the route to see some few projects i have worked on
